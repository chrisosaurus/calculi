# calculi

A WIP collection of various calculi implementations and typing rules


## Lambda Assignment

Minimum-viable lambda calculus with assignment interpreter.

Lambda calculus terms are represented by a Haskell ADT,
there is no external syntax and thus no lexer or parser.


## Running the tests

To run the unit tests:

    $ make


## Viewing the semantics

To build and view the semantics for a given calculi

    $ cd docs/LambdaAssignment
    $ make view
